     - Jupyter Notebook
     - This notebook file is a template that guides you through the protocol and analysis function development process.
       
       The resulting protocol and function then can be added to the `openJII <https://openjii.org>`_ platform to be used in experiments.
       Of cause you can also save this in the same file format as the protocols in this library and use them locally.
   * - :download:`MultispeQ Calibrations <_static/downloads/Calibrate MultispeQ Device.ipynb>`
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - The MultispeQ calibration requires multiple steps in a specific order in order to be successfully calibrated.
       
       The notebook file provides instructions on how to calibrate the device and guides through the process.
       
       The protocols for the calibration are automatically installed with the libraries required to run the notebook.
