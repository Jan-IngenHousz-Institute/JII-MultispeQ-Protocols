Installation
============

First we must make sure we have the ``JII MultispeQ Protocols`` library installed:

.. code-block:: bash
  
    pip install git+https://github.com/JII/JII-MultispeQ-Protocols.git --upgrade --no-cache-dir

After the installation, a set of inital protocols including analysis functions for the data returned by the MultispeQ is available.

Further a function to validate protocols is provided, helping to check protocols, before trying them with a MultispeQ device.

.. note::

   The collection of protocols is supposed to increase over time. Users can submit their protocols to be shared with the community.
